Notes:

* Devise has been preconfigured with a user model. To activate devise for this model, uncomment 'devise_for :users' from the routes file. Also if you aren't using Refinery CMS as well, you must move 'devise.rb' from 'config/disabled_initializers' to 'config/initializers'.
* OmniAuth has been preconfigured to work with Devise and the User model (via Authentications).  To turn on, uncomment 'has_many :authentications' in /models/user.rb.  Also uncomment the gem 'omniauth' and move the 'omniauth.rb' file from 'config/disabled_initializers' to 'config/initializers'.
* Refinery CMS must be installed using the terminal. From the project directory, run:
rails generate refinerycms
rake db:migrate
Extra configuration may be required depending on the current state of the project.
See http://refinerycms.com/guides/attaching-refinery-cms-to-an-existing-rails-application for additional detail. Also since RefineryCMS already uses Devise, 'gem devise' can be left commented out in the Gemfile.
* Fancy Buttons requires extra configuration, simply uncomment the line "require 'fancy-buttons'" from compass.rb.

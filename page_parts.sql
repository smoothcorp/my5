Tim led our audience of 300+ delegates in a series of exercises to “wake up” and energize them during the day of presentations. The audience enjoyed the stretches and realised that these techniques are easy to implement and would improve their team’s performance during the daily work day. </p>\r\n<p>The My 5 techniques strengthen healthy workplace strategies and practices. </p>\r\n<h2>QBE LMI</h2>\r\n<p>Tim recently facilitated a one hour workshop for employees across a number states. The workshop covered a range of specific stretches and postural exercises for the workplace environment that can help improve posture and release muscular tension. Our employees found the workshop very practical with many really enjoying the opportunity to practise what they''ve learnt. I''ve seen many of the posters Tim provided hanging around the office and people were really keen to practice their stretches. Thanks Tim for a great practical workshop!</p>\r\n<h2>CMC Markets Asia Pacific</h2>\r\n<p>I thought his approach, techniques and teaching methods were great - very clear and precise. Tim always kept in mind that we are in an office environment and the stretches he showed us were appropriate. He also showed us some that as he mentioned should be done at home. Tim came around and made sure we were all doing the particular movements correctly as to not harm ourselves. The cards and posters he left us to put around the office and to take away and to keep reminding us were great too. If anyone had any questions I thought that he answered them with a lot of fact and satisfied the person asking the question and also made further suggestions to assist in particular parts of the body that were causing problems.</p>\r\n<h2>Christine Ammann, Kinesiologist, SA</h2>\r\n<p>I love the My5 program as it incorporates a quick fix for everyone at any time, combining five very powerful modalities that work extremely well together.  When doing my administration work I often spend long periods of time sitting in front of my computer or marking assignments, and I guess, like most people, forget to take a break every so often.  By the end of the day of course, I end up with sore shoulder and neck muscles and weary eyes!  Having the program loaded onto my computer with the timely reminder set - I can relax and focus on my work until I am told what to do!  Being able to choose from different techniques without much fuss is great and improves my productivity - plus I still have enough energy left at the end of the day to spend time with my family without being tired, grumpy or sore - laugh!</p>\r\n<h2>Angela Stott, La Source International</h2>\r\n<p>When looking at options where we wanted to not only retain our staff but also promote well being in the work place, we were finding it a challenge to find a concept that would really work without taking up too much employee time.  Once we signed up to the program, we were instantly impressed with the ease of functionality of the program, the appeal to our employees and also the sheer professionalism of it all.  It is a seamless journey for the user and a valuable tool for any company looking to invest that little extra in their team.</p>\r\n<h2>Mimi Fong, Amicas Global&#160;</h2>\r\n<p>My 5 impressed me with its innovative yet simple approach to wellness in the workplace. It takes the basic principle of " Healthier employees equals greater productivity levels" and transforms this into easy to follow exercises which can be done anywhere in the workplace. My 5 has made a tangible difference to my business particularly in boosting concentration and alertness levels throughout the day. It is a must for any organisation serious in their commitment towards maintaining and enhancing the health and wellbeing of their most valuable assets - their employees.</p>', 0, '2011-10-07 05:05:44', '2012-05-06 23:57:08'),

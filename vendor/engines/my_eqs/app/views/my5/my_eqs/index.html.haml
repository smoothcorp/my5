      %h3 Emotions are an integral part of how think, reason, engage and communicate from day to day.
      %p Emotional intelligence is a measure of how effectively we manage the interplay between thought and emotion, both for ourselves and when interacting with others. When our emotions are appropriately expressed and balanced, we make better decisions, our problem solving abilities improve, and we can cope with change and lifeâ€™s challenges more effectively.  My EQ leads you through a practical five step process to help you increase self awareness and social awareness, improving self management and enhancing your relationship management skills.
